  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Hydaly Ouanesavanh</strong> <em>(High-duh-lee Won-suh-vahn)</em> and I've been a professional IT Technician with over 5 years of experience. Helping people is one of my favorite things to do. It feels like I have been my parents "IT support" ever since birth.
  I <em>love</em> the critical thinking that comes with these roles and I'm an absolute sponge. I'm willing to learn as much as I can to better improve myself and help others.</p>
  <h4>Why learn progamming?</h4>
  <p>I want to be a part of the growth of technology and to contribute to it as much as I can. I enjoy being creative and thinking outside of the box. I really feel like programming will be a wonderful outlet for that.</p>
